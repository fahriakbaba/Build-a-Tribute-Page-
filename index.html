            <ul>
                <li><strong>1971</strong>
                    Elon Reeve Musk was born on October 28, 1971 in South Africa.</li>
                <li><strong>1981 </strong>
                    At the age of 10, his parents bought him a computer with a book on how to operate and create your own games, which supposedly takes an average person 6 months to complete. However, Musk was able to finish it in just 3 days. 2 years later he created a game called 'Blastar' and was able to sell it for $500.</li>
                <li><strong>1995</strong>
                    He founded Zip2, a company that provided and licensed online city guide software to newspapers. In 1999 Zip2 was acquired by Compaq for US$307 million.</li>
                <li><strong>1999</strong> Elon Musk founded X.com, an online bank that later merged with 'Confinity' which had a money transfer service called PayPal. The merged company focused on the PayPal service and was renamed PayPal in 2001. In October 2002, PayPal was acquired by eBay for US$1.5 billion in stock, of which Musk received US$165 million./li>
                <li><strong>2002</strong>
                    With US$100 million of his early fortune, Musk founded Space Exploration Technologies, or SpaceX, in May 2002. SpaceX develops and manufactures space launch vehicles with a focus on advancing the state of rocket technology. The company's first two launch vehicles are the Falcon 1 and Falcon 9 rockets (a nod to Star Wars' Millennium Falcon), and its first spacecraft is the Dragon (a nod to Puff the Magic Dragon).</li>
                <li><strong>2003</strong>
                    Tesla. The company was named after the Serbian-American electrical engineer and physicist Nikola Tesla by company co-founders Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning. Elon joined later as CEO after he invested US$7.5 million with personal fund.</li>
                <li><strong>2013</strong>
                    On August 12, 2013, Musk unveiled a concept for a high-speed transportation system ( Hyperloop) incorporating reduced-pressure tubes in which pressurized capsules ride on an air cushion driven by linear induction motors and air compressors. The mechanism for releasing the concept was an alpha-design document that, in addition to scoping out the technology, outlined a notional route where such a transport system might be built: between the Greater Los Angeles Area and the San Francisco Bay Area.</li>
                <li><strong>2015</strong>
                    In December 2015, Musk announced the creation of OpenAI, a not-for-profit artificial intelligence (AI) research company. OpenAI aims to develop artificial general intelligence in a way that is safe and beneficial to humanity. By making AI available to everyone, OpenAI wants to "counteract large corporations who may gain too much power by owning super-intelligence systems devoted to profits, as well as governments which may use AI to gain power and even oppress their citizenry".</li>
                <li><strong>2016</strong>
                    In June 2016, Musk's car company, Tesla, formally submitted an offer to acquire SolarCity, a company that was founded by Elon's cousins Lyndon and Peter Rive.</li>
                <li><strong>2016</strong>In 2016, Musk co-founded Neuralink, a neurotechnology startup company, to integrate the human brain with artificial intelligence. The company, which is still in the earliest stages of existence, is centered on creating devices that can be implanted in the human brain, with the eventual purpose of helping human beings merge with software and keep pace with advancements in artificial intelligence. These enhancements could improve memory or allow for more direct interfacing with computing devices.</li>
                <li><strong>2016</strong>On December 17, 2016, while stuck in traffic, Musk tweeted "Am going to build a tunnel boring machine and just start digging..." The company was named 'The Boring Company'. The first tunnel will start on the SpaceX campus, and will probably go to a nearby parking garage.</li>

            <blockquote>
                <p>"If somebody graduated from a great university, that may be an indication that they will be capable of great things, but it's not necessarily the case. If you look at, say, people like Bill Gates or Larry Ellison, Steve Jobs, these guys did not graduate from college, but if you had a chance to hire them, of course that would be a good idea."</p>
